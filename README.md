# NBA Over/Under Daily Tracker

The NBA Over/Under Daily Tracker is a Python application designed to swiftly gather data for every game scheduled on a given day. With this tool, you can access current information on each quarter, team totals, and the current over/under for each NBA game.

To ensure accurate and up-to-date data, the NBA Over/Under Daily Tracker pulls information from both the NBA official API and Odds-API. It's worth noting that Odds-API offers up to 500 free monthly calls for your convenience.
